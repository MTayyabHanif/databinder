# DataBinder
A small and pretty simple tool for data binding. No dependencies, written in pure JavaScript, supports IE9+.

## Usage
[Visit CodePen demo](http://codepen.io/andrew-r/pen/GJYjYa)

## API
```javascript
// creating new instance of DataBinder

var config = {
  // string
  // selector that specifies the DOM element to bind
  el: '.widget__title',

  // object
  // specifies the data to bind
  model: {},

  // object
  // specifies callbacks that will be called after initializing, updating or rendering
  // all callbacks have access to current DataBinder instance by using `this` keyword
  callbacks: {
    onInit:   function() {},
    onUpdate: function(changes) {
      // some manipulations with changes object
      return changes;
    },
    onRender: function() {}
  }
}

var binding = new DataBinder(config);

// updating the model
// will cause rendering immediately
binding.update({
  title: 'Ads'
});

// rendering the model
// useless because of automatic calling of this method immediately after updating the model
binding.render();
```
